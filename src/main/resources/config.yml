# ItemProgressions example configuration
# Define rules that lock items until specific conditions are met.
# Each rule specifies a set of materials (supports * wildcard matching against Material enum names)
# and an unlock condition (realtime, per-player playtime, or global server uptime).

# Message shown to players when an action is blocked. Available placeholders:
# %item% - the Material name
# %remaining% - human readable remaining time (if applicable)
message: "&cYou can't use %item% yet. Unlocks in %remaining%."

# How often a player can get the blocked message in seconds to prevent spam
messageCooldownSeconds: 1

# Allow breaking of locked blocks
allowBreaking: true

# Allow dropping of locked items (if false, players cannot drop locked items from their inventory)
allowDropping: false
