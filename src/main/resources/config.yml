# and an unlock condition (realtime, per-player playtime, or global server uptime).

# Message shown to players when an action is blocked. Available placeholders:
# %item% - the Material name
# %remaining% - human readable remaining time (if applicable)
message: "&cYou can't use %item% yet. Unlocks in %remaining%."
